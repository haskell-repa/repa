repa
====

Repa provides high performance, regular, multi-dimensional, shape polymorphic parallel arrays. 
All numeric data is stored unboxed. Functions written with the Repa combinators are automatically
parallel provided you supply +RTS -Nwhatever on the command line when running the program.

* Home page and bug tracker are on a [separate site](http://repa.ouroborus.net/).

* PULL REQUESTS: If you want your pull request merged then send email to benl AT ouroborus.net. I don't pay attention to github notifications, but am happy to receive emails from people. Before raising your pull request make sure *all* the packages still build and that the examples still work.

* If you just want to bump a dependency version then get a package maintainer or Hackage trustee to edit the package information directly on Hackage. You don't need to raise a pull request here.
